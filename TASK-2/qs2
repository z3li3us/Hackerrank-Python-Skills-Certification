Python: Shape Classes with Area Method

Implement two classes:
Rectangle:
	The constructor for Rectangle must take two arguments that denote the length of the rectangle’s sides
	The class must have an area method that returns the area of the rectangle

Circle:
	The constructor for Circle mist take one argument that denotes the radius of the circle
	The Circle class must have an area method that returns the area of the circle. To implement the area method, use a precise Pi value(math.pi)

Round the answer to 2 decimal places

Sample Case

Input:
2			->number of queries, q=2
circle 1		-> query parameters = [“circle 1”, “rectangle 2 3”]
rectangle 2 3

Output:
3.14
6.00

Explanation:
There are 2 queries. In the first of them, an object of class Circle with radius 1 is constructed.
Then, the value of its area property with exactly 2 decimal points, is printed to the output.
Since the radius of circle is 1, then the printed area is π〖*radius〗^2.
In the second query, the object of class Rectangle is constructed with side lengths of 2 and 3.
Then, the value of its area property, with exactly 2 decimal points, is printed to the output.
Since the side lengths are 2 and 3, the printed area is 6.00
